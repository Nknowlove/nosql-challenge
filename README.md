Assignment Task

This task is about nonSQL project, which evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating.

Instructions

1.	Firstly, I was stuck for a long time while importing the pymongo. I used VSC when I learned the course. When I saw the teacher using the jupyter notebook, I switched. However, the pymongo cannot be imported. I figured this out after taking a long time researching on website. I reset the Kernel and use the same version of python with VSC, then this problem was sloved.

2.	Secondly, I tried many times, but the answer “ Find the BusinessTypeID for "Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen" and return only the BusinessTypeID and BusinessType fields” always went wrong. Until I learn how to use the projection function, I solved this problem.

3.	For the last question of part 2, I really took long time to figure it out. I do not quite understand the mean why the example gives the “non_ratings = ["AwaitingInspection", "Awaiting Inspection", "AwaitingPublication", "Pass", "Exempt"]”. It took me lots of time to make it clear.

4.	When I coded question 2 from Part 3, I always got the print result as 0. It drove me crazy. I could not solve this problem until I saw the hint from the text. I used the $regex operator to locate the London establishments. Because the London Local Authority has a longer name than "London" .

Declaration

During the project, I used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others.
